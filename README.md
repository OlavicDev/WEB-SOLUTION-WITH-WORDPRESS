# WEB-SOLUTION-WITH-WORDPRESS
As a DevOps engineer, setting up a web solution with WordPress involves several key steps that integrate development, operations, and system administration principles to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable web environment. Here's an introduction to this process:

## Overview
WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) used for creating websites and blogs. It's known for its ease of use, extensive theme and plugin ecosystem, and strong community support. Deploying WordPress in a production environment involves several components and steps, which are crucial for ensuring performance, security, and scalability.

## Key Components
1. Web Server: Typically, Nginx or Apache is used to serve WordPress content.
2. Database Server: MySQL or MariaDB is commonly used for storing WordPress data.
3. PHP Runtime: PHP is required to run WordPress scripts.
4. Reverse Proxy: Nginx or Traefik can be used to handle SSL termination and load balancing.
5. Containerization: Docker can be used to package WordPress and its dependencies, making deployment more consistent across different environments.
6. Orchestration: Tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes can manage multi-container WordPress deployments.
7. CI/CD Pipeline: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines automate the deployment process, ensuring that changes are tested and deployed efficiently.

# Deploying a Websolution with Wordpress
With this project one will understand the concept of Three-tier Architecture

In this case the:
laptop serves as the client(presentation tier)
Ec2 (where the wordpress will be installed) will serve as the web sever(application tier)
another Ec2 as the database(data tier)

## Step-1 Prepare a Web Server
1. Launch a RedHat EC2 instance that serve as Web Server. Create 3 volumes in the same AZ as the web server ec2 each of 10GB and attache all 3 volumes one by one to the web server.
